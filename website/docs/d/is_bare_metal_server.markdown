# ibm\_is_bare_metal_server

Import the details of an existing IBM Cloud virtual server instance  as a read-only data source. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.


## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "ibm_is_vpc" "testacc_vpc" {
  name = "testvpc"
}

resource "ibm_is_subnet" "testacc_subnet" {
  name            = "testsubnet"
  vpc             = ibm_is_vpc.testacc_vpc.id
  zone            = "us-south-1"
  ipv4_cidr_block = "10.240.0.0/24"
}

resource "ibm_is_ssh_key" "testacc_sshkey" {
  name       = "testssh"
  public_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub")
}

resource "ibm_is_instance" "testacc_instance" {
  name    = "testinstance"
  image   = "a7a0626c-f97e-4180-afbe-0331ec62f32a"
  profile = "bc1-2x8"

  primary_network_interface {
    subnet = ibm_is_subnet.testacc_subnet.id
  }

  network_interfaces {
    name   = "eth1"
    subnet = ibm_is_subnet.testacc_subnet.id
  }

  vpc  = ibm_is_vpc.testacc_vpc.id
  zone = "us-south-1"
  keys = [ibm_is_ssh_key.testacc_sshkey.id]
}

data "ibm_is_instance" "ds_instance" {
  name        = "${ibm_is_instance.testacc_instance.name}"
  private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
  passphrase  = ""
}

```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `name` - (Required, string) The name for this virtual server instance .
* `private_key` - (Optional, string) The private key of the ssh key used in the creation of virtual server instance in PEM Format. It is used to decrypt Windows administrator default password for the virtual server instance if the image used is of type `windows`.
* `passphrase` - (Optional, string) The passphrase used in the creation of encrypted ssh key pair. If non encrypted ssh key pair is used in the creation of the virtual server instance, this field can be omitted.
